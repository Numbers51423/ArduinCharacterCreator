Arvalessa 

Background: Arvalessa is a barbaric yet sophisticated civilization where most of the people are superstitious and illiterate while the ruling class is an incredibly rich, highly educated group in full control. 

Dress & Decoration: Dress and appearance is centered on convenience and social ranking. Light skin and paleness is seen as noble and avoidance of the sun separates the high and low castes. Body piercing is 

common as well as the practice of removing all hair from the body. The cut, texture and appearances of garments are more important than function or even price. Outlook: A strict social order system of 8 castes,

 where each caste descends in purity dominates everything. This caste system is perpetuated socially, religiously and economically. Society: Very strict caste society with no social movement allowed. The ruling

 elite hold all the power and wealth and serve as religious authorities as well for the superstitious and illiterate masses. Religion & Power: The nation has strong religious overtones with the Vedic Mysteries 

a very powerful force in the country.
