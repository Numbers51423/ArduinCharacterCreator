Maragoré 

Background: Maragoré was a restless, but relatively stable kingdom, known for its tough, diverse people. A central king ruled over small provincial satrapies and as long as the central taxes were paid and the 

fighting internally was not too unbearable, the provinces and their races were left alone and the central government away. A time came however, where this was not enough and internal warring led the country to 

ruin and left a Urukk led horde of diverse races in its place, ruling the war ravaged bones of what is left of Maragoré. Dress & Decoration: The horde that exists in Maragoré has no singular means of dress or 

decoration. Outlook: While as varying in outlook as composition, every race in Maragoré seeks independence and autonomy and attacks with savage intensity any attempts to rebuild the old monarchy. Each racial 

group fights internally with the other over space and rights to land or spoils. Society: The entire region is chaos and what little social structure exists is a military driven one centered on the Urukk led 

forces that sacked capitol and nominally lead the horde. Religion & Power: No single belief exists and varying attitudes towards magik, religion, psychic power and technology exist. All races, however, view 

spiritualism with reverent awe and pay homage. Prejudices & Fears: The horde that exists in Maragoré has a wide ranging set of beliefs, prejudices and fears.
