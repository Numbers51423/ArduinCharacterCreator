Altala 

Background: A young nation birthed out of the womb of several ancient empires. Altalans are vibrant, active people, bustling whether they are working the land, plying the water in ships or trekking the dunes of

 the desert. Dress & Decoration: Altalans view dress, appearance and etiquette as an art form and have the proper ensemble and protocol for every occasion. Such things are unreasoningly important and more than 

once a fight, blood feud, riot or war has occurred over the subject. Outlook: Optimists, little gets Altalans down for long. Full of blazing passion, Altalans tend to jump headfirst into anything without 

looking back. It's their nature to hotly decide one way or another on a subject and defend it without thought to consequence or truth/untruth. All in all, Altalans are a highly charged people. Society: A 

foundation of society is the need to build and its an unreasoning almost overpowering urge. When not fighting Panduria or Thund, Altalans spend the time attempting to outdo one among with grand constructions. 

Its almost as if they can fight back the darkness of their passionate souls through the very act of creation. Politics are important and while the average Altalan may not play a great role politically, for some

 it shapes their entire existence. When shamed or disgraced an Altalan will seek reparation through the act of sacrifice or dissolution in an attempt to redeem their shame. Religion & Power: Religiously 

Altalans are diverse but Justinorn and Chu-Khem are powerful symbolically in their culture. Magik is viewed favorably and seen as a natural force of life. Psychic power, spiritualism and technology are little 

known outside of isolated social pockets and is generally ignored or lumped into magik. Prejudices & Fears: Placing disgrace on their family, their name or the honor of their country, giving birth to twins or 

breaking from the proper protocol in life.
