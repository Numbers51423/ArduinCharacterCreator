Amazon Motherland 

Background: A collection of Amazon city states on the eastern coast whose origins arose from the disputes and wars of the Misty Isles in the distant past. Dress & Decoration: Clothing tends toward the simple, 

with cotton and silk dyed brightly, with colors reflecting the city states are most common. Outlook: Athleticism, bravery in the face of death, toughness, especially in battle, is greatly admired. Confidence 

and passion lead them to believe they can overcome any physical enemy. The ideal that citizenship must be earned is a highly valued concept. Society: Amazonian culture reflects a high stress on individuality 

and self action. Cities are self ordered and ruled by those capable not through hereditary lines. Warriors are considered among the elite and all people serve in the military for a few years. Religion & Power: 

Primary religions are the Olympic Mysteries, Megalon (female version), Chu-Khem, Amarydion, Silvery Lady, Brabnalda, and Xuanth. Magik is viewed favorably and seen as a natural force of life while psychic power

 and technology is viewed as a rarer form of magik. Spiritualism strikes a deep chord and their folk lore, legends and tales are full of animistic references. Prejudices & Fears: Amazons do not view males of 

any race as equals, seeing them as less capable in every way. This prejudice ranges from the mild ideal that males should be kept safe to the extreme where all males should be treated like the lowest of 

animals.
