Atenveldt 

Background: A prosperous land ruled by a feudal monarchy with natural boundaries that have kept the country isolationist. The land is split into 4 major fiefdoms with kings who owe allegiance to a high king. 

This arrangement has worked well for Atenveldt and spawned a vast pool of landed nobility that plot, squabble and war with one another and the neighboring kingdoms. Dress & Decoration: Loose, long sleeved 

shirts are worn, usually covered with a jerkin (leather for commoners and more expensive material for nobility and the rich), tucked into or draped over trousers. Women favor gowns, skirts and loose clothes 

with an eye towards functionality but beauty as well. Outlook: Land is everything and a landed man is a rich man. A person's pedigree speaks louder than any famous deed or mountain of wealth. A man rich in 

nobility is a man rich in ancestors. The rose is sacred and an oath upon it is binding upon one's family, blood and descendants. Such a thing is never done lightly. Society: Atenveldt appears chaotic to 

outsiders, buts is orderly and law abiding in nature by guided by tradition and custom more than the written codex of law. These unwritten rules are why others see Atenveldti as contrary and capricious. 

Religion & Power: Religiously open with the deities of Megalon, Vanaan, and Diora as the most powerful. The use of magik, technology, psychic power and spiritualism is looked upon with great distrust, suspicion

 and unease. Religious magik is accepted but still makes many uneasy. Prejudices & Fears: Atenveldti are trained from birth to follow all forms of unspoken rituals, like giving way before a mounted rider, 

courtesy to women and so on, while fearing in some way they have forgotten to act is some proper fashion. Bloodlines are equally important and forgetting one's heritage is a criminal act.
