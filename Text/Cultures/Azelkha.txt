Azelkha 

Background: A wild but civilized country perched on the northern edge of the civilized world, the last bastion between the wild untamed north and the civilized world. Azelkha was born out of the displacement of

 people from Khorsar when the gods flooded the lands in their anger. The way of governing and general mindset of the people grew out of this event and the harsh struggles that occurred in the new land that 

would become Azelkha. Dress & Decoration: Garments favor bright colors and flashy, flamboyant garments that capture the eye and tantalize the mind. Azelkhans love to display their material wealth and do so we 

all kinds of accouterments. They use a heavier collared version of the Khorsarian overcoat. Tattoos and skin decoration are common. Outlook: Hard work is a way of life and a person can no more shirk a task than

 disbelieve in the gods. To be Azelkhan is to do nothing halfway – indeed they do nothing without full commitment. Two cultural orientations drive Azelkhans – wealth and land. Both are of overriding concern and

 a typical Azelkhan makes no bones out of gaining 1 or both whenever possible. Society: A powerful plutocracy rules the nation and this privileged upper class are built on wealth, competence and ability. The 

lords of the land turn over frequently though as literally anything goes in Azelkha. Religion & Power: Azelkha has no state religion and indeed has a wild variety of deities. All powers are viewed tolerably in 

the land and they have a great respect for spiritual animism. Prejudices & Fears: Bath is welcome but swimming is despised if not feared. Wading in water over their heads inspirits panic.
